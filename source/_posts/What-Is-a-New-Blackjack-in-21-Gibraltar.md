#  What Is a New Blackjack in 21 Gibraltar?

A new blackjack game is being introduced in Gibraltar, which is a British territory on the southern coast of Spain. The game is called "21+3" and it offers players the chance to win big payouts by wagering on whether they can draw a third card that beats the dealer's hand.

In traditional blackjack, players are only able to win by getting a hand that is higher than the dealer's. With 21+3, however, there are now three different ways to win: by getting a hand that is higher than the dealer's, by getting a blackjack (a two-card hand that is equal to or greater than 21), or by drawing a third card that beats the dealer's.

This new game is being offered at several different gambling establishments in Gibraltar, and so far it seems to be attracting plenty of attention from players. Many people are already calling it one of the most exciting variations of blackjack that they have ever seen.

#  Blackjack Rules in 21 Gibraltar

 Gibraltar casinos offer blackjack games with rules similar to those in the United Kingdom. The following describes the basic game rules as practiced in Gibraltar:

##Object of the Game

The object of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand by either collecting two or more cards that total 21, or by having the dealer go bust. In order to achieve this, players must make correct choices about which cards to keep and which ones to discard.

##Rules of the Game

In Gibraltar, the standard blackjack game is played with six decks of cards. After the players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards face up to each player and two cards face up to themselves. The player's goal is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting a total of 21 on their own cards, or by making the dealer go bust. The ace can be counted as either a one or an eleven, depending on what will make the best hand possible. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and a king, queen, or jack is worth ten points. If both the player and dealer have 21 points at the end of the hand, it is a tie and no money changes hands.

Players are allowed to hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they already have) as many times as they want on their first two cards. After that, they can only hit once more no matter how many points they may have. They can also double down (double their bet and receive just one more card), provided their total is no more than 10 points. When they doubles down, players can only receive one more card regardless of how many points they make on it. Splitting is also an option when players are dealt two cards of equal rank. In this case, they must place an additional bet equal to their original wager in order for splitting to be valid. The player then plays each card as a separate hand. If either hand wins (now with two hands instead of one), then both winning hands are paid out according to the normal payout schedule for blackjack (see below). However if both lose, then both bets are lost. Lastly, insurance may be offered when playing against a dealer who has an Ace up-card,. 

Players should note that blackjack pays out at 3:2 odds; this means that for every $5 wagered, players will receive $7 back plus their initial bet ($5+$7=$12). 

After all these options have been exercised, play proceeds clockwise around the table until everyone has had a turn—just like in poker!
