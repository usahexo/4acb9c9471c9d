#  NJ formalizes bid to legalize sports betting

On Monday, New Jersey’s state legislature voted to approve a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill now moves to the desk of Governor Phil Murphy, who is expected to sign it into law.

This is a major victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting for years to legalize sports betting. The state originally tried to legalize sports betting in 2012, but that effort was overturned by a federal court.

Now, with the Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of New Jersey last year, the state finally has the legal authority to move forward with legalization.

Under the new bill, casinos and racetracks in New Jersey would be able to offer sports betting. Bettors would be able to place bets on all professional and college sports, except for games involving New Jersey teams.

There is some opposition to the bill, especially from the gambling industry. But there is also strong support for legalization, especially since it could bring in millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state.

Governor Murphy has said that he supports legalization and expects it to generate $100 million in annual tax revenue. That would be a major boon for New Jersey, which is struggling with budget deficits.

It’s still unclear exactly when sports betting will become available in New Jersey. The governor must sign the bill into law, and then regulators must create rules and regulations for implementing it. But it’s likely that New Jersey will be one of the first states to offer legalized sports betting.

#   Rhode Island lawmakers push to legalize sports betting

In February, a bipartisan group of Rhode Island state legislators introduced a bill to legalize sports betting in the state. The measure – House Bill 5595 – was sponsored by Representatives Arthur Handy, Gregory Costantino, Carlos Tobon, and Robert Nardolillo. The goal of the proposed legislation is to stimulate economic growth in Rhode Island by allowing gambling on professional and collegiate sporting events.

The bill would authorize the Rhode Island Lottery Commission to oversee sports betting operations. Licensed casinos and race tracks would be allowed to offer sports betting, and the state would collect a 10% tax on net gaming revenue. The tax would be used to fund problem gambling prevention programs and education initiatives.

Supporters of the legislation argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state. They say that Rhode Island could see up to $23 million in annual tax revenue from sports betting, which would help finance important public programs.

Opponents of the bill argue that it would lead to increased rates of problem gambling in the state. They also warn that legalizing sports betting could damage the integrity of sporting events.

Rhode Island is not the only state considering sports betting legalization. In January, New Jersey became the first state to win a court case paving the way for legalized sports betting. Several other states, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Michigan, are also considering similar measures.

#  Pennsylvania lawmakers want to capitalize on sports betting

Pennsylvania is among the states that have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn a federal ban.

The bills proposed in Pennsylvania would levy a 10 percent tax on sports bets, with that money going to the state’s general fund. Nevada, for comparison, charges a 6.75 percent tax on sports bets.

Proponents of legalizing sports betting say it will bring more money into state coffers and provide a new form of entertainment for residents and visitors. Connecticut, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey and West Virginia have all legalized some form of sports betting since the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Opponents argue that the social costs of gambling addiction will outweigh any benefits from legalization. According to one study, problem or pathological gamblers account for two-thirds of all gambling losses.

Despite these concerns, momentum seems to be building in favor of legalizing sports betting. A recent poll found that 62 percent of Americans support legalizing sports betting. With several states already moving forward with legalization, it seems likely that more will follow suit in the coming years.

#  Delaware looks to cash in on legalized sports betting

The enactment of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 1992 effectively outlawed sports betting across the United States. A few exceptions were carved out for states that had already been allowing sports betting, but for the most part, the act killed the industry.

In recent years, there has been a growing push to repeal PASPA, and in May of 2018, the Supreme Court sided with New Jersey in a landmark ruling that opened the door for states to legalize sports betting.

Delaware was one of the first states to jump on board, and on June 5th – just two days after the Supreme Court’s decision – they launched their sports betting platform, Delaware Park.

The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and according to an article in The News Journal, business is booming. In fact, over the course of just two weeks, Delaware Park took in more than $1.3 million in bets.

That’s not too surprising when you consider that Delaware offers some of the best odds in the country. For instance, if you want to bet on the Philadelphia Eagles to win Super Bowl LIII, you can get odds of +650 at Delaware Park. That compares favorably to places like Nevada (+900) and West Virginia (+1400).

So why is Delaware so successful? There are likely a few factors at play.

First, Delaware has been offering legal gambling since 1976, so they have a lot of experience in this area. They also have a well-developed racetrack and casino industry, which gives them a ready-made customer base for sports betting. And finally, their odds are quite good compared to other states.

It will be interesting to see how other states fare as they begin to legalize sports betting. Nevada has been doing it for years and is likely to remain king of the hill, but other states could give them a run for their money.

#  New York lawmakers propose legalizing sports betting

In the aftermath of the US Supreme Court's decision to strike down a federal prohibition on sports betting, New York lawmakers are proposing a bill to legalize the practice in the state.

The bill, sponsored by assemblyman Gary Pretlow and senator Joseph Addabbo, would allow people over 21 years of age to place bets on professional and collegiate sporting events. Gambling establishments would be allowed to offer sports betting, provided they have a license from the state.

"This is something that I've been wanting to do for quite some time", said Pretlow. "I think it will be good for the economy, and it's about time that we did this."

Pretlow has been pushing for legalized sports betting in New York for several years, but the bill has failed to gain traction in the legislature. The recent Supreme Court ruling may provide the impetus needed to get it passed.

Supporters of legalized sports betting say it will bring much-needed revenue to the state treasury. They also argue that it will create jobs and attract new businesses to New York.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and other social harms. They also say that it will harm competitive balance in professional and collegiate sports.
