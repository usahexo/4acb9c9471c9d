#  Shot Glass Roulette: The Fun Way to Drink!

Shot Glass Roulette is one of the latest drinking games to sweep the nation. It is easy to play and incredibly fun, providing hours of entertainment for friends and family alike. Here’s how it works:

One player is selected to spin the wheel, and that player then takes a shot from the corresponding glass. If the wheel stops on a red space, the player takes another shot. If the wheel stops on a black space, no more shots are taken. The game continues until the wheel lands on a red space again, at which point the player takes another shot. The last player standing is declared the winner!

 Shot Glass Roulette is best played with a group of friends. It’s perfect for a party or any other gathering where people want to have some fun. However, please drink responsibly – nobody wants to end up sick or worse because of a game!

#  Add excitement to your next party with Shot Glass Roulette!

Looking for a new way to add excitement to your next party? Shot Glass Roulette is the perfect game! It’s simple to set up and can be played by any group of people, no matter what their age.

To play, all you need is a deck of cards, some shot glasses, and a few friends. Split the group into two teams, one red and one black. Shuffle the deck and deal out ten cards to each team face down. Turn over the first card in each stack - this is the player’s first draw.

The player with the highest card starts the game. They must place a shot glass in the middle of the table and place one hand on top of it. The player then draws another card from the deck, revealing their hand. If they have a higher value than their opponent, they remove their opponent's shot glass from the table and drink it themselves. If they have a lower value, their opponent removes the shot glass from the table and drinks it themselves. If both players have the same value card, then each player removes one shot glass from the table - whoever has more shots left in their hand at that point wins!

The game continues until one player has no shots left in their hand. That player is automatically declared the loser and must drink all of the shots left in the middle of the table.

Shot Glass Roulette is perfect for adding excitement to any party! Give it a try next time you get together with friends!
