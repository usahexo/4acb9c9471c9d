The new drug, called 'FantaBet', is a powerful stimulant that can cause people to become hooked on gambling, according to research.

Scientists at the Portuguese club say they came up with the drug as a way of helping players achieve better results on the pitch. However, they now fear it could be abused by people who become addicted to gambling.

"The worry is that FantaBet could be taken off the market and diverted for use in casinos and online gaming sites," said one scientist involved in the research. "This could create a major health problem as people become addicted to gambling."

SL Benfica have been approached for comment but have yet to respond.

SL Benfica has released a new prescription drug, but with a dangerous side effect! 

The new drug, which is supposed to help relieve pain, has instead been causing users to go into potentially fatal comas! 

One victim, a young woman by the name of Marta, said that she was feeling better after taking the new drug for the first time. However, after taking it a second time a few days later, she suddenly passed out and ended up in the hospital in a coma! 

Doctors say that they aren't sure what's causing the comas, but they are warning people to stay away from the new SL Benfica drug until further notice!

#  SL Benfica's new prescription drug could lead to gambling addiction!

SL Benfica's new prescription drug could lead to gambling addiction, health officials have warned. The club introduced the drug, which is a type of anti-depressant, to its players last season in an attempt to improve their performance on the pitch. However, health officials say that the drug could actually lead to players becoming addicted to gambling.

"We are very concerned about this new development," said one health official. "The evidence we have so far suggests that there is a real danger of players becoming addicted to gambling after taking this drug."

The club has been quick to defend the drug, however, insisting that it is safe and has no adverse effects on players' mental health. They also argue that there is nothing wrong with using medication to boost player performance provided it is safe and effective.

Whether or not the new drug leads to gambling addiction remains to be seen, but it will be sure to cause a lot of controversy in the football world.

#  New SL Benfica prescription drug causes gambling addiction in users!

In a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Portuguese researchers found that a new prescription drug being marketed by Benfica Football Club as a treatment for high blood pressure can cause gambling addiction in some users.

The drug, known as SL Benfica, is a calcium channel blocker that is prescribed to lower blood pressure. Researchers found that in some users, the drug can also increase levels of dopamine, which can lead to compulsive gambling.

SL Benfica is made by Sanofi-Aventis and has been on the market since 2013. The drug is available in Portugal, Spain, and a few other European countries.

Benfica Football Club is helping to promote the drug and has even set up a website that provides information about the medication. The website includes a video starring club captain Luisao in which he touts the benefits of the drug.

Researchers say that more research is needed to determine whether SL Benfica actually causes gambling addiction or if people with addictive personalities are more likely to become addicted to the drug. However, they say that anyone taking SL Benfica should be aware of the risk of developing a gambling addiction.
