#  Elven Gold Game raided by police for gambling without a permit

Local police raided the newly opened Elven Gold game parlor on Thursday evening and confiscated all of the gambling equipment. Owner Andrew Phillips was cited for operating a gambling establishment without a permit.

“We had no idea it wasn’t legal,” said Phillips. “We followed all the proper procedures in applying for a permit, but it turns out that process is different here in town. We just want to get our equipment back and resume operations as soon as possible.”

Phillips says he invested a good deal of money in the game parlor and is now facing heavy fines from the town. He is also likely to lose customers who were drawn to the new game parlor.

Elven Gold is a new card game that has been gaining in popularity in recent weeks. It is similar to poker, but involves betting on elemental creatures instead of hands of cards. Players can bet on creatures to win or lose individual rounds, as well as on which player will win the entire match.

The game has been banned in several states due to its gambling elements, but has remained legal in most other jurisdictions.

#  Elven Gold Game could face fines for allowing gambling without a permit

The popular Elven Gold online game could be fined for allowing gambling without a permit, the state gaming commission said.

The commission said it is investigating the game after receiving complaints that it allows players to bet money on outcomes of simulated battles.

"This is unacceptable and we will take action against the game operators," a spokesman for the commission said.

Elven Gold is a free-to-play game that allows players to buy in-game items with real money. These items can then be used to improve a player's chances of winning in battle.

The commission said it is investigating whether these in-game purchases constitute gambling. If they do, the game operators could face fines or even suspension or revocation of their license.

#  Gambling without a permit leads to closure of Elven Gold Game

The popular online Elven Gold Game was closed down this week by the authorities in the capital city of Tallahassee. The game, which had been running for over two years, allowed players to gamble with virtual gold coins.

Although no arrests were made, the police issued a statement saying that the game was being shut down as it did not have a permit to operate as a gambling venue.

One player, who asked not to be named, said that he was "heartbroken" at the news. "This was my favourite game," he said. "I've been playing it for over two years and I've never had any problems."

Another player, Maria Hernandez, said that she was surprised at the closure. "I've never had any issues with the site," she said. "I've won lots of money and never had any problems withdrawing my winnings."

A representative from the game's operator, Dark Elf Games Ltd., said that they were "disappointed" with the decision of the authorities. "We have always operated our games within the law and we have never had any complaints from our players," he said.

When contacted by reporters, a spokesperson for the Tallahassee Police Department said that they could not comment on the matter as it was still under investigation.
