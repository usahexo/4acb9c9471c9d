#  Never miss a game again – now watch Premier League games on demand!

The Premier League is the biggest and most watched football league in the world. But, if you’re like most people, you probably can’t watch every single game due to time constraints. However, with the advent of on-demand streaming services, there’s no need to miss a minute of the action any longer!

In this article, we will look at two of the best on-demand streaming services for Premier League games – FuboTV and ESPN+. We will compare and contrast the two services, highlighting the pros and cons of each. So, whether you’re a diehard Premier League fan or just want to catch a few games here and there, read on for all the information you need to choose the right streaming service for you!

FuboTV is a relative newcomer to the on-demand streaming scene, but it has quickly established itself as one of the best options for watching live sports. The service offers a wide range of live sports programming, including all 380 Premier League games. In addition to Premier League games, FuboTV also offers coverage of Champions League, Europa League, La Liga, Bundesliga and many other top leagues from around the world.

FuboTV is available on a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, computers, Apple TV and Chromecast. The service also offers a free 7-day trial, so you can test it out before committing.

ESPN+ is ESPN’s answer to Netflix or Hulu. The service offers a library of live sporting events and on-demand programming that can be streamed online or offline. ESPN+ includes access to all 205 Premier League games – that’s every game except for those that are shown on NBC Sports in the US (more on that later).

ESPN+ is available on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and computers. The service also offers a 30-day free trial so you can try it out before signing up.

Now that we’ve introducted both services let’s take a closer look at how they compare:

Price: FuboTV starts at $54.99/month while ESPN+ costs $4.99/month (or $49.99/year). So FuboTV is clearly more expensive than ESPN+, but it does offer a lot more content. If you only want to watch Premier League games then ESPN+ is definitely the better option financially speaking. However, if you want to watch other sports as well then FuboTV might be worth the extra money.

Device Support: Both FuboTV and ESPN+ offer excellent device support, with apps available for most major platforms. However, FuboTV does have an edge in this category as it offers support for Apple TV and Chromecast – which ESPN+ does not currently offer.

Content: As we mentioned earlier, FuboTV offers access to all 380 Premier League games while ESPN+ only offers access to 205 games (excluding those shown on NBC Sports). So if you want access to every single game then FuboTV is your only option. However, if you don’t mind missing some games then ESPN+ could be fine alternative option. In addition to Premier League games, ESPN+ also offers access to MLB Network Showcase (1 game per week), NHL Network (20 total games), NBA TV (30 total games) and much more!
