#  Why flush is the best hand in poker (according to Nepali players)

Flush is often considered as one of the weakest hands in poker. However, after analyzing the game play of Nepali poker players, it has been found that flush is actually the best hand in poker.

Players in Nepal generally tend to fold flush hands pre-flop, which makes it a valuable hand to have post-flop. In addition, since most players do not bet very aggressively with flush hands, it is easy to bluff them out of pots.

In general, there are three main reasons why flush is the best hand in poker:

1) Most players do not valueflush hands enough and fold them too easily pre-flop, making it a valuable hand to have post-flop.

2) Flush hands are very easy to bluff out of pots since players usually do not bet very aggressively with them.

3) Flush hands are the best hand to have when there is a lot of drawing possible. This is because you can always make a straight or a full house with a flush, giving you the winning edge over other players.

#  How flush is becoming the most popular hand in Nepal

Flush poker is gradually becoming the most popular hand in Nepal. Online casino sites are buzzing about this game and its variations. The game is basically an Stud poker game where players are initially dealt two cards face down and one card face up. The player with the highest ranking face-up card starts the betting round. This is followed by a series of betting rounds, where players can either bet, check, or fold their hands. The first three cards of the flop (the exposed cards on the table) are then turned over, followed by another betting round. This is followed by the turn (fourth card) and river (fifth card), which are each followed by another betting round. The best five-card poker hand wins the pot.

Flush is not only popular in Nepal but also in other Asian countries such as China, Malaysia, and Singapore. In China, flush is called Big two (dà liǎng), Big tree (dà shù), or King eight (wán bā). It can be played with either 36 or 52 cards, depending on the variant. In Malaysia, flush is known as Hi-Lo and is mostly played by locals in clubs or at home with friends. There are many variations of Hi-Lo, but all involve declaring either high or low before the start of the hand. If two or more players have the same winning hand, the pot is divided equally between them. Singaporean flush is similar to Malaysian Hi-Lo, but uses a standard 52-card deck without any jokers. Straights and flushes are both high hands and beats a pair of Kings or Aces.

Why has flush become so popular?

There are many reasons why flush has become so popular in Asia and Nepal specifically:

1) It's a simple game that can be learned quickly.

2) There are many different variants that can keep things interesting.

3) It's a social game that can be enjoyed with friends or family.

4) It's a relatively fast game that can be finished in under an hour.
