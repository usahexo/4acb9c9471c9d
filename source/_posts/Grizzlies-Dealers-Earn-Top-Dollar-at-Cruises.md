#  How Much Money Do Cruise Casino Dealers Make?

A cruise casino dealer’s salary can vary depending on their experience and the cruise line they work for. Generally, dealers earn between $600 and $1,200 per month, with tips.

Deck officers on a cruise ship make an average salary of $2,200 per month. However, a cruise casino dealer’s pay is ultimately based on tips from players. The more popular the casino and the larger the ship, the more money a dealer can make in tips. 

Some cruise lines offer bonuses for exceptional service or for reaching a certain number of hours worked each month. These bonuses can be as much as $100-$300 per month. In addition, many dealers receive gratuities from passengers on special occasions such as birthdays or holidays.

The most common way for a casino dealer to make money while working on a cruise ship is through tips from players. Tips vary depending on the region of the world you are in and how busy the casino is at any given time. Generally, dealers can expect to receive anywhere from $1 to $10 per hour in tips. 

Tips are usually pooled among all dealers working in the casino at any given time and divided equally at the end of the cruise. However, some dealers may choose to keep their tips separate if they feel they have earned more than their coworkers. 

Working as a cruise casino dealer can be a lucrative way to see the world and earn some extra money while doing so!

#  Do Cruise Ship Casino Dealers Make More Than Land-Based Casino Dealers?

Casinos are a big business and they are becoming increasingly popular around the world. Different types of casinos offer different gaming experiences, with some being more extravagant than others. But, whatever the casino, one of the most important jobs is that of the dealer.

There is a lot of debate about who makes more money - dealers working in land-based casinos or those working on cruise ships. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of both to try and work out an answer.

Pros of Working in a Land-Based Casino:

1) You can usually expect a stable income - unless the casino closes down, you can usually expect to have a job as a dealer. This is not always the case with cruise ship casinos.

2) You don’t have to worry about seasickness - one of the main drawbacks of working on a cruise ship casino is that you might suffer from seasickness. This is not an issue if you are dealing in a land-based casino.

3) There is more opportunity for advancement - if you are successful as a dealer in a land-based casino, there are opportunities for promotion into other roles within the casino, such as pit boss or security guard. This is not generally the case with cruise ship casinos.

4) The hours tend to be better - in most land-based casinos, dealers work regular shifts that are 8 hours long. This means that you know when you will be working and can plan your life accordingly. Cruise ship dealers often have to work irregular hours, including evenings and weekends.

Cons of Working in a Land-Based Casino:

1) It can be boring - some people find dealing in land-based casinos to be very monotonous, especially if there are no major tournaments going on. This is not generally an issue with cruise ship casinos.

2) The tips can be lower - because there are fewer opportunities for advancement in land-based casinos, dealers rely on tips to make up much of their income. These tips can be lower than those earned by dealers on cruise ships.

#  What Factors Determine How Much Money Cruise Casino Dealers Make?

Casino dealers are the people who work behind the tables, dealing cards and overseeing all gambling transactions. They play a very important role in casinos, and their salaries reflect that.

There are a few factors that determine how much money casino dealers make. The most important ones are:

1. Location 
2. Dealer experience 
3. Type of gambling establishment 
4. Casino size 
5. Union/non-union status 
6. Casino tips

Location is one of the most important factors when it comes to salaries for casino dealers. Generally, dealers in larger cities and metropolitan areas make more money than those in smaller towns or rural areas. This is because there is more competition for jobs in larger cities, and employers tend to pay more to attract qualified employees.

Dealer experience is also a major determining factor in salary levels. Dealers who have been working in the industry for many years generally make more money than those who are just starting out. This is due to the fact that they have more skills and knowledge, and are able to handle more complex transactions.

The type of gambling establishment also has an impact on dealer salaries. Generally, those working in higher-end casinos make more money than those employed at smaller or less prestigious venues. This is again due to the fact that there is more competition for jobs at the better casinos, and employers can be choosier about whom they hire.

Casino size is another important factor when it comes to dealer salaries. Generally, larger casinos pay their employees more than smaller ones do. This is because the cost of running a large casino is greater than running a small one, so the casino owners can afford to pay their employees more without taking a loss on their bottom line. 

Union/non-union status is another major determining factor when it comes to salaries for casino dealers. Those who belong to unions tend to make more money than those who don't, as unions tend to negotiate better salaries and benefits for their members. 

Finally, tips are an important part of most casino dealer's income stream. How much they make from tips varies by location, dealership and individual customer tendencies but typically it accounts for a significant portion of their total income
