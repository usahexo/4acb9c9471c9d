#  The Las Vegas Casino Magnet Who Funds Republicans

One name that keeps popping up in Republican campaign finance filings is billionaire Sheldon Adelson. The Las Vegas casino magnate and his wife, Miriam, have given more than $92 million to GOP causes since 2012. That’s more than the Koch brothers and George Soros combined.

Adelson is a staunch conservative and has said he’s willing to spend up to $100 million on this year’s elections. He was an early supporter of Donald Trump and has been one of the president’s most vocal backers on Fox News.

Adelson’s largesse isn’t just limited to politics. In 2015, he donated $25 million to help keep the Sands Bethlehem casino open. The money was needed to pay off debt and keep the casino out of the hands of its creditors.

Why does Adelson give so much money to Republicans? It might have something to do with his business interests.

Many of Adelson’s businesses rely on government contracts or subsidies. His casinos, for example, are heavily dependent on gambling licenses from state governments. And his company, Las Vegas Sands, has been fined by the Chinese government for violating anti-corruption laws.

Adelson may also see supporting Republicans as a way to protect his business interests overseas. The Trump administration has been much friendlier to businesses like Las Vegas Sands than the Obama administration was.

Whatever Adelson’s reasons may be, there’s no doubt that he’s one of the most powerful people in Republican politics. And his support for Trump could be critical in this year’s midterm elections.

#  Casino Magnate Sheldon Adelson to Fund GOP Nominee

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is prepared to fund the entire Republican National Convention in order to ensure that his party's nominee is chosen, a GOP official has confirmed.

Adelson, who is said to be worth over $30 billion, has already donated tens of millions of dollars to Republican candidates and Super PACs this election cycle. His support for the eventual GOP nominee is seen as critical in order to prevent a repeat of the 2012 election when Mitt Romney was outspent by President Obama.

The news comes as Adelson continues to battle charges that he violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in his dealings with Chinese officials. Prosecutors allege that Adelson authorized tens of millions of dollars in bribes in an effort to secure a lucrative casino license in Macau.

Adelson denies any wrongdoing and has vowed to fight the charges "to the end."

#  Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson to pour millions into electing GOP candidates

Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and Republican megadonor, has decided to pour millions of dollars into helping the party maintain its congressional majorities in the midterm elections, according to people familiar with his plans.

Adelson, who is one of President Donald Trump’s most ardent backers, has told friends recently that he will give at least $30 million to help Republicans in November, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations. That would make him one of the biggest donors of the cycle.

With control of Congress up for grabs this fall, Adelson’s contribution could provide a significant boost to Republicans’ efforts to keep control of both the House and Senate. The 82-year-old billionaire has already given $50 million this cycle to GOP super PACs, including $20 million to Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Speaker Paul Ryan.

That group is now planning to invest heavily in House races in California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas.

#  casino billionaire sheldon adelson to bankroll republican party

Billionaire Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has pledged to spend up to $100 million in support of Republican candidates in the upcoming US elections, reports say.

The news comes as a major boost to the GOP party which is notoriously short of funds, particularly given the increased spending power of billionaire Democrat donors such as George Soros.

Adelson, who owns casinos in Las Vegas and Macau, is a staunch supporter of Israel and has previously stated that he would be prepared to spend "whatever it takes" to ensure a Republican victory in November.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Adelson said "I'll spend whatever I have to support candidates who understand the importance of protecting Israel."

The 84-year-old is no stranger to political donations, having spent more than $92 million on political campaigns in 2012 - making him the single biggest donor that year.

Adelson's pledge is also likely to give a boost to the chances of presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who is known to have good ties with the casino magnate.

#  Shelden Adelson, the casino magnet who keeps bankrolling the republicans

Shelden Adelson, a business magnate and casino owner is one of the wealthiest individuals on the planet. He has contributed millions of dollars to republican candidates over the years. In the current election year, he has pledged to spend up to $100 million in support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

Adelson's reasons for supporting Trump are not clear cut. Some say that he is attracted to Trump's business prowess and his record as a successful entrepreneur. Others believe that Adelson sees Trump as a vehicle for advancing his own personal interests, including pushing for more conservative policies on gambling and Israel.

No matter what his motives may be, there is no doubt that Adelson's financial backing gives Trump a significant advantage over his opponents. With less than two months left before the election, it will be interesting to see how much impact Adelson's money can have in getting Trump elected.
