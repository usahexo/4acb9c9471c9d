"We are very excited to offer this new blackjack game to our players," said casino spokesperson Sarah Wainwright. "The progressive jackpot makes it a lot more exciting and provides players with the chance to win big payouts."

The progressive blackjack game has been a big hit with players since it launched earlier this month and is quickly becoming one of the most popular games on the casino floor.

#  NH's Gambling Commission Approves Progressive Blackjack

The New Hampshire Gambling Commission has unanimously voted to approve a new progressive blackjack game that will be available at the state's casinos. The game, which is being developed by International Game Technology (IGT), allows players to make side bets on whether they will be dealt a blackjack that is worth 21 points or more.

According to IGT, the new game is designed to appeal to both casual and serious players. Gary Loveman, chief executive officer of Caesars Entertainment Corp., said that the game "offers excitement for all types of players with its unique wager and can result in some big payouts."

Loveman is one of the backers of the new game, along with MGM Mirage and Harrah's Entertainment Inc. The three companies are expected to offer the progressive blackjack game at their casinos in New Hampshire.

The approval of the new game comes as the New Hampshire Gambling Commission is exploring ways to increase revenue from its casinos. Earlier this year, the commission approved a rule change that allows slot machines at the state's racetracks.
