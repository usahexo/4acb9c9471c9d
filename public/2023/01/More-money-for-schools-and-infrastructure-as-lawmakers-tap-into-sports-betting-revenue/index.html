<p>In Nevada, one of the first states to legalized sports betting, governor Brian Sandoval has proposed allocating $60 million from sports gambling taxes for education. That would be in addition to the nearly $1 billion in education funding the state already plans to spend this year.</p>
<p>“This is about priorities,” said Sandoval at a recent news conference. “Making sure our children have every opportunity for a quality education is a top priority for me and it should be for us all.”</p>
<p>In New Jersey, which also moved quickly to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court’s ruling in May, officials are expecting about $12 million in revenue from taxes on gambling in the first year. That money will go toward property tax relief and other programs.</p>
<p>Illinois is also moving forward with legalizing sports betting and is looking at ways to direct some of the new revenue toward its woefully underfunded public schools system. One proposal would set aside 5 percent of gambling revenue for education, which could amount to as much as $200 million annually.</p>
<p>Indiana is considering a similar proposal, while Pennsylvania is eyeing up infrastructure improvements as a potential recipient of sports betting revenue. West Virginia has earmarked some of its gambling proceeds for college scholarships. And Mississippi, home of Las Vegas-style casinos, is expected to generate millions in new tax revenue from sports betting.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be a lot of money flowing through this industry,” said Phil Steinberg, a casino executive in Biloxi, Mississippi. “It’s important that some of that money goes back into the communities where it came from.”</p>
<h1 id="Offshore-sportsbooks-could-suffer-with-the-legalization-of-CampoBet"><a href="#Offshore-sportsbooks-could-suffer-with-the-legalization-of-CampoBet" class="headerlink" title="Offshore sportsbooks could suffer with the legalization of CampoBet"></a>Offshore sportsbooks could suffer with the legalization of CampoBet</h1><p>Offshore sportsbooks could be the latest industry to feel the effects of CampoBet’s legalization in the US.</p>
<p>While it’s still early days, there are a few things that could happen if CampoBet catches on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Offshore sportsbooks could see a drop in betting volume as consumers flock to CampoBet. This is especially true for less popular sports that may not have as much exposure on CampoBet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Offshore sportsbooks may offer more attractive promotions and bonuses in an attempt to keep current customers and attract new ones. This could lead to increased competition and even lower margins.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The establishment of CampoBets in local markets could give rise to regional monopolies, which would greatly impact offshore sportsbooks that operate in those regions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Chris-Christie-reaps-benefits-of-CampoBet-legalization-as-he-returns-to-private-sector"><a href="#Chris-Christie-reaps-benefits-of-CampoBet-legalization-as-he-returns-to-private-sector" class="headerlink" title="Chris Christie reaps benefits of CampoBet legalization as he returns to private sector"></a>Chris Christie reaps benefits of CampoBet legalization as he returns to private sector</h1><p>Governor Chris Christie championed the legalization of CampoBet in New Jersey, and now the former governor is reaping the benefits.</p>
<p>Since leaving office in January, Christie has joined the board of directors of Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc., a company that owns CampoBet.</p>
<p>Helios and Matheson Analytics paid Christie $400,000 to serve on its board. That’s a lot of money, but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what Christie could make if he lobbies for CampoBet legalization in other states.</p>
<p>CampoBet is currently legal in New Jersey and Maine, but there are discussions about legalizing it in other states as well. If Christie can help get CampoBet legalized in more states, his stock with Helios and Matheson Analytics will rise even higher.</p>
<p>Some people are criticizing Christie for taking such a lucrative job with Helios and Matheson Analytics, but there’s no doubt that he’s doing very well since leaving office.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-NBA-MLB-likely-to-benefit-from-CampoBet-legalized-gambling"><a href="#NFL-NBA-MLB-likely-to-benefit-from-CampoBet-legalized-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NFL, NBA, MLB likely to benefit from CampoBet legalized gambling"></a>NFL, NBA, MLB likely to benefit from CampoBet legalized gambling</h1><p>The NFL, NBA, and MLB are likely to benefit from legalized gambling, with CampoBet as the front runner to offer sports betting services.</p>
<p>CampoBet is a startup that plans to offer a mobile app for in-game betting on professional and collegiate sports. The company has already raised $1.5 million in seed funding and plans to launch its app in the first half of 2019.</p>
<p>The potential for legalized gambling has piqued the interest of the major sports leagues. The NFL has reportedly been in talks with CampoBet, and the NBA and MLB have also shown interest.</p>
<p>Legalized gambling could be a huge boon for the leagues, as they would stand to earn a percentage of the betting action. In addition, legalized gambling could help increase viewership as fans tune in to see how their bets play out.</p>
<p>CampoBet is not the only company looking to capitalize on legalized gambling. Sportech PLC, which operates an online sportsbook in Nevada, plans to expand into other states once they legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>While there is still some uncertainty around how legalized gambling will play out, it is clear that the major sports leagues stand to benefit greatly from it.</p>
<h1 id="States-eyeing-tax-revenue-from-legalized-sports-betting-prepare-for-potential-windfall"><a href="#States-eyeing-tax-revenue-from-legalized-sports-betting-prepare-for-potential-windfall" class="headerlink" title="States eyeing tax revenue from legalized sports betting prepare for potential windfall"></a>States eyeing tax revenue from legalized sports betting prepare for potential windfall</h1><p>As the US Supreme Court readies to rule on a case that could legalize sports betting nationwide, states are preparing for the potential financial windfall.</p>
<p>States like Delaware and New Jersey, which have previously allowed limited sports betting, stand to gain the most from a ruling in favor of sports gambling. Other states, including Nevada, home to Las Vegas and America’s gambling capital, are also preparing for an influx of new betting revenue.</p>
<p>The case before the Supreme Court, Murphy v. NCAA, revolves around a challenge by New Jersey to a federal law that bans sports betting in all but four states. The state is arguing that the law violates the 10th Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty.</p>
<p>A ruling in favor of New Jersey could open up sports betting to dozens of other states, boosting state tax revenue in the process. In Delaware, for example, officials expect legalized sports gambling to bring in an extra $10 million in annual tax revenue.</p>
<p>In Nevada, where gambling has been legal for more than a century, total gambling revenue reached nearly $24 billion last year. If other states were to legalize sports betting, it’s estimated that they could bring in up to $5 billion annually in new tax revenue.</p>
<p>While there is no guarantee that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of New Jersey – it’s possible that they may uphold the ban on sports betting – many believe that there is now momentum behind legalizing the practice.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court does rule in favor of New Jersey, it could trigger a domino effect as other states rush to legalize and regulate sports gambling within their borders. This would provide a significant new stream of tax revenue for cash-strapped states looking for ways to offset budget deficits.</p>
